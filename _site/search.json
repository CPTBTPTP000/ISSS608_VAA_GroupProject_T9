The following steps will be taken: \n\nData Cleaning:  \n\nHandling Missing value (removal of incomplete records) \nIdentify and remove duplicate records \nStandardize data formats (date formats, numerical conversions) \n\n\n\nFiltering and Transformation  \n\nSelect key variables relevant to the study, such as clean water access,\n\n\n\nData Integration\n\nMerge data on typhoid outbreaks (2000–2022) from the Center for Open Science (OSF), cholera cases from the WHO (2000–2023) via Kaggle (extra from WHO), and World Development Indicators (WDI) from the World Bank (2000–2023) to analyze the relationship between waterborne diseases and access to unsafe water sources. This integration will help assess how trends in cholera and typhoid correlate with water quality and accessibility over time.\nGeocode data for geospatial visualization"

Discussion on the Project Topic\nPrior to the meeting, we reviewed senior work and explored possible topic areas.\nProposed Ideas\nXinyue:\n\nTropical rainforest dynamics coverage analysis (rejected due to lack of data)\nSDG Goal 2 - Zero Hunger, focusing on food waste and world hunger statistics (initially agreed upon but later rejected due to difficulties collecting food waste data)\nWorld health issues (considered but rejected as most data only covered 2019 and 2022 with many missing values, making time series forecasting difficult)\n\nJing:\n\nSingapore population demographics analysis and forecast (rejected due to decreasing fertility rates and unpredictable immigration numbers)\nGerman population demographic shift analysis alongside policies for foreigners and immigrants (rejected due to unfamiliarity with German policies)\nWorld GDP analysis and time series forecast (rejected due to varying industry focuses across countries and the associated workload\nThe future of AI and workplace (rejected due to limited available data)\n\nMeihao:\n\nMaritime port import/export analysis focusing on Singapore’s trading relationships (rejected due to unclear motivation)\nTourism and CPI/exchange rate analysis for seasonal changes and tourist season forecasting (initially agreed upon but rejected due to difficulties obtaining historical exchange rates)\nHow do jet fuel price effect Singapore Airline Group’s Revenue( rejected due to difficulties obtaining historical Oil Price for a reliable source)\n\nSelected Topic\nAfter reviewing Xinyue’s data, the team generated the idea of exploring water-related issues. Relevant datasets were found, and the topic was selected. The team agreed to work on water sanitation issues such as:\n\nSufficient data is available for analysis\nThe topic includes appropriate variables for study\n\n2. Division of Tasks for Project Proposal\nAfter reviewing senior work, the team decided on the proposal structure and distributed responsibilities:\nJing:\n\nMotivation\nObjectives\nProblem statement\nData\nGitHub and Netlify setup\n\nXinyue:\n\nSketch of the prototypes and Explanation\nExpected contribution and impact\nConclusion\n\nMeihao:\n\nMethodology\nProject schedule\nRelevant work\nR package list\n\n3. Action Items\n\nAll members to push their work to GitHub for peer review\nJing will handle the final submission on Wednesday"
