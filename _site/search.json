    "text": "Water is fundamental to life, yet billions worldwide still lack access to safe drinking water and sanitation. As of 2022, 2.2 billion people lacked safely managed drinking water, while 3.5 billion had no access to safe sanitation. Waterborne diseases such as cholera and typhoid continue to pose serious public health threats, particularly in regions with inadequate water infrastructure. Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) aims to ensure universal access to water and sanitation, but current progress is insufficient, requiring accelerated efforts to meet global targets.\nObjectives:\nThis project seeks to analyze and visualize global disparities in water accessibility, sanitation, and health outcomes. By leveraging statistical and geospatial analysis, we aim to:\n\nIdentify regions with severe water stress and sanitation deficiencies.\nAssess the relationship between water accessibility and waterborne diseases.\nForecast future trends in water safety and sanitation.\nExamine investment disparities and transboundary water cooperation gaps.\n\nApplication Features:\nOur team will develop an interactive web-based visual analytics application using Shiny to democratize data access and insights. The key features include:\n\nGeospatial Mapping: Interactive heat maps and choropleth maps visualizing water stress, disease outbreaks, and investment gaps.\nTime Series Analysis: Forecasting water accessibility improvements, sanitation trends, and disease prevalence using ARIMA, STL, and SARIMA models.\nConfirmatory Data Analysis (CDA): Statistical validation of the relationship between water access, health outcomes, and investment impact.\nInteractive Dashboards: Allowing users to explore country-level insights and trends over time.\nInvestment & Policy Insights: Identifying underfunded regions and evaluating the effectiveness of water infrastructure investment.\n\nThis project aims to support efforts to ensure universal access to clean water and improve global health outcomes through data-driven approaches."
