# Motivation

Water is essential for life, yet millions around the world still lack access to clean water and sanitation. As of 2022, **2.2 billion** **people** lacked safely managed drinking water and basic hand-washing facilities, **3.5 billion** lacked safely managed sanitation and **2.4 billion** lived in water-stressed countries.

[Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) ](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal6) aims to ensure universal access to water and sanitation. However, at the current pace, billions will continue to face these challenges by 2030.

# Problem Statement

To meet [Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6)](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal6) targets, the global rate of progress must accelerate significantly — 6x for drinking water, 5x for sanitation, and 3x for hygiene. Achieving these targets would save **829,000 lives** annually, the number of people who currently die each year from diseases directly linked to unsafe water, inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene.

This project aims to analyze and visualize global water accessibility, sanitation trends and their impact on public health. Using data from the World Bank and health related dataset, we will:

-   Identify spatial disparities in clean water access and unsafe water-related deaths.

-   Analyze time-series trends to assess progress in water safety and sanitation overtime.

-   Examine the statistical relationship between water access and disease prevalence (Cholera, Typhoid)

-   Assess investment gaps by analyzing government and international funding in water infrastructure and sanitation programs

-   Evaluate transboundary water cooperation, identifying regions where shared water resources require coordinated management to improve accessibility and sustainability

This project aims to support efforts to ensure universal access to clean water and improve global health outcomes through data-driven approaches.

# Data Source & Scope 

This project will explore global trend in water accessibility sanitation and related health impacts using multiple datasets. The primary source is the [World Development Indicators (WDI)](https://databank.worldbank.org/reports.aspx?source=2&series=SP.POP.TOTL&country=) from the World Bank, which compiles extensive development data across 266 countries from 1960 to 2023. Given the large dataset, only relevant indicators will be selected to align with the project's objectives.

Potential variables from WDI may include indicators related to drinking water access, sanitation services, hygiene practices, water stress and water productivity. These factors will help assess disparities in water availability and quality across different regions.

Additionally, the project will incorporate health related datasets to examine the link between water conditions and waterborne disease prevalence:

-   [Typhoid Fever Incidence (2000 -2022)](https://osf.io/kew4d/) from the Center for Open Science (OSF)

-   [Cholera Case Data (from 1949 onward)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/cholera-dataset), extracted from the [WHO ](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.174?lang=en) on Kaggle

By integrating these data sources, the project aims to provide data-driven insight into the impact of water accessibility and sanitation on public health. This findings can help policy makers, organizations and government target resource more effectively to ensure equitable access to safe water and sanitation worldwide.

## Data Preparation

Before conducting any analysis, we will ensure that the dataset is clean, structured for analysis, and suitable for visualization. The following steps will be taken: 

### Data Cleaning:  

-   Handling Missing value (removal of incomplete records) 
-   Identify and remove duplicate records 
-   Standardize data formats (date formats, numerical conversions) 

### Filtering and Transformation  

-   Select key variables relevant to the study, such as clean water access,

### Data Integration

-   Merge data on typhoid outbreaks (2000–2022) from the Center for Open Science (OSF), cholera cases from the WHO (2000–2023) via Kaggle (extra from WHO), and World Development Indicators (WDI) from the World Bank (2000–2023) to analyze the relationship between waterborne diseases and access to unsafe water sources. This integration will help assess how trends in cholera and typhoid correlate with water quality and accessibility over time.
-   Geocode data for geospatial visualization  

## Geospatial Data Analysis  

The objective of the geospatial Data Analysis is to understand and identify spatial disparities in water accessibility and unsafe water-related deaths while assessing investment gaps and policy effectiveness. 

Visualization Approach:

-   Interactive heat map will be developed that represents: 
    -   Areas with low access to clean water  
    -   High Concentration of unsafe water usage  
    -   Outbreak cases of Cholera and Typhoid
-   Choropleth Maps will be used to illustrate severity levels with different color intensities represents:
    -   Water stress levels and sanitation access disparities

    -   Disease incidence across different region

    -   Transboundary water cooperation gaps in shared water resources.

    -   Policy effectiveness, comparing investment levels vs actual progress in improving water access and sanitation

    -   Investment disparities in water and sanitation infrastructure showing region with high vs.low funding levels.

## Time series Analysis  

The object of this analysis is to identify the trend and predict future patterns in water safety and sanitation overtime and related health risks over time.

Incorporate forecasting models using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) for overall trend forecasting, Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL) to analyse the seasonal variation and long term patterns and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) to incorporate both trend and seasonality to project future trends in:  

-   Water accessibility improvements over the years

-   Death rates linked to unsafe water (waterborne disease incidence trends).

-   Changes in sanitation coverage

## Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA) 

The objective of confirmatory data analysis is to validate the statistical relationship between water accessibility sanitation and health outcomes using correlation, hypothesis testing and regression models.

-   Correlation Analysis

    -   Assess the relationship between clean water access and the incidence of waterborne disease (Cholera & Typhoid)

    -   Examine how unsafe water exposure correlates with mortality rates due to waterborne dieases.

-   Hypothesis Testing:

    -   Conduct t-tests and ANOVA to determine if significant different exist in water access levels across different regions.

-   Regression Modelling:

    -   Evaluate the impact of sanitation access and clean water availability on the incidence of waterborne diseases

    -   Quantify the extent to which improvements in water infrastructure reduce health risks.

    -   Assess the effect of investment in water and sanitation on overall health outcomes.
