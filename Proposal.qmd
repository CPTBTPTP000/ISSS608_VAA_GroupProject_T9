## Data Preparation

Before conducting any analysis, we will ensure that the dataset is clean, structured for analysis, and suitable for visualization. The following steps will be taken: 

### Data Cleaning:  

-   Handling Missing value (removal of incomplete records) 
-   Identify and remove duplicate records 
-   Standardize data formats (date formats, numerical conversions) 

### Filtering and Transformation  

-   Select key variables relevant to the study, such as clean water access, death rate per 100,000 population  

### Data Integration

-   Merge Typhoid outbreak 2000 - 2022 from Center for Open Science (OSF) with World Bank sanitation statistic 2000 - 2023 for understanding the relationship between waterborne disease and access to unsafe water source  
-   Geocode data for geospatial visualization  

## Geospatial Data Analysis  

The objective of the geospatial Data Analysis is to understand and identify spatial disparities in water accessibility and unsafe water-related deaths.  

-   Interactive heat map will be developed that represents: 
-   Areas with low access to clean water  
-   High Concentration of unsafe water usage  
-   Death rate due to unsafe water usage and sanitation  

The choropleth maps will be used where different color intensities represent severity level. 

## Time series Analysis  

The object of this analysis is to identify the trend and predict future patterns in water safety and sanitation overtime  

-   Incorporate forecasting models using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL) and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) to project future trends in:  
-   Water accessibility improvements over the years  
-   Death rates related to unsafe water  
-   Sanitation coverage change (People with basic handwashing facilities including soap and water % of population) over time  
-   Identify in seasonal spikes, long-term trends in water safety  
-   Design interactive time sliders for temporal exploration  
-   Evaluate and compare different forecasting model 

## Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA) 

The objective of confirmatory data analysis is to validate the statistical relationship between water accessibility, sanitation and health outcomes.  

-   Correlation Analysis will be conducted to determine relationship between  
-   Clean water access and health outcomes  
-   Unsafe water exposure and mortality rate attributed to unsafe water, sanitation.  
-   Hypothesis testing of t-test and ANOVA will be conducted to verify significant difference in water access between different regions  
-   Regression model will be used to examine the influence of sanitation and water

# R packages

The team intends to use the following R packages to develop and deploy the interactive visual analytics application

-   **tidyverse**: A family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis, and communication tasks, including creating static statistical graphs.

-   **knitr**: A report generation tool that facilitates dynamic document creation in R.

-   **dplyr**: An R package for data manipulation and working with data frames efficiently.

-   **plotly**: An R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs and visualizing data dynamically.

-   **DT**: An R interface to the JavaScript library **DataTables**, which creates interactive tables for HTML pages.

-   **lubridate**: An R package that simplifies working with **dates and time elements**.

-   **ggforce**: An extension of **ggplot2** that provides additional geoms and stats for advanced visual data analysis.

-   **highcharter**: A wrapper around the ‘Highcharts’ JavaScript library, allowing for highly interactive and customizable plotting of R objects.

-   **sf**: An R package that supports the **importing, managing, and processing of geospatial data**, essential for mapping analysis.

-   **spdep**: An R package that facilitates spatial analysis by handling geospatial data dependencies and relationships.
