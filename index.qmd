Water is fundamental to life, yet billions worldwide still lack access to safe drinking water and sanitation. As of 2022, **2.2 billion people** lacked safely managed drinking water, while **3.5 billion** had no access to safe sanitation. Waterborne diseases such as **cholera and typhoid** continue to pose serious public health threats, particularly in regions with inadequate water infrastructure. **Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6)** aims to ensure universal access to water and sanitation, but current progress is insufficient, requiring **accelerated efforts** to meet global targets.

**Objectives:**

This project seeks to **analyze and visualize global disparities** in **water accessibility, sanitation, and health outcomes**. By leveraging statistical and geospatial analysis, we aim to:

-   Identify **regions with severe water stress and sanitation deficiencies**.

-   Assess the **relationship between water accessibility and waterborne diseases**.

-   Forecast **future trends** in water safety and sanitation.

**Application Features:**\
Our team will develop an **interactive web-based visual analytics application** using **Shiny** to democratize data access and insights. The key features include:

-   **Treemap Visualisation:** Displaying disparities in water stress, disease outbreaks, and investment gaps across regions, identify the trend and areas of concern.

-   **WASH-Based Health Trend Analysis:** Forecasting **WASH indicator**(water stress, water sanitation, etc )and **Health Indicator**( DiarrheaRate, TyphoidRate) using combined PLM and Time Series Analysis (ARIMA).

-   **Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA):** Statistical validation of the relationship between **water access, health outcomes**.

-   **Interactive Dashboards:** Allowing users to explore **Region-level insights** and trends over time.

This project aims to support efforts to ensure universal access to clean water and improve global health outcomes through data-driven approaches.
