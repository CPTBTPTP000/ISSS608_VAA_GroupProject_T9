This project aims to analyse, visualise and forecast trends in clean water access, unsafe water exposure, and health outcome through and interactive visual analytics platform. By leveraging geospatial mapping, time series forecasting, and confirmatory data analysis, we seek to:

-   identify regions most affect by unsafe water and sanitation

-   analyze the historical trends in waterborne disease incidence

-   confirm statistical relationships between unsafe water and public health outcome

We aim to support efforts in ensuring universal access to clean water and improving global health outcomes.
