Water is fundamental to life, yet billions worldwide still lack access to safe drinking water and sanitation. As of 2022, **2.2 billion people** lacked safely managed drinking water, while **3.5 billion** had no access to safe sanitation. Waterborne diseases such as **cholera and typhoid** continue to pose serious public health threats, particularly in regions with inadequate water infrastructure. **Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6)** aims to ensure universal access to water and sanitation, but current progress is insufficient, requiring **accelerated efforts** to meet global targets.

**Objectives:**

This project seeks to **analyze and visualize global disparities** in **water accessibility, sanitation, and health outcomes**. By leveraging statistical and geospatial analysis, we aim to:

-   Identify **regions with severe water stress and sanitation deficiencies**.

-   Assess the **relationship between water accessibility and waterborne diseases**.

-   Forecast **future trends** in water safety and sanitation.

-   Examine **investment disparities** and **transboundary water cooperation gaps**.

**Application Features:**\
Our team will develop an **interactive web-based visual analytics application** using **Shiny** to democratize data access and insights. The key features include:

-   **Geospatial Mapping:** Interactive **heat maps and choropleth maps** visualizing water stress, disease outbreaks, and investment gaps.

-   **Time Series Analysis:** Forecasting **water accessibility improvements, sanitation trends, and disease prevalence** using **ARIMA, STL, and SARIMA models**.

-   **Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA):** Statistical validation of the relationship between **water access, health outcomes, and investment impact**.

-   **Interactive Dashboards:** Allowing users to explore **country-level insights** and trends over time.

-   **Investment & Policy Insights:** Identifying **underfunded regions** and evaluating **the effectiveness of water infrastructure investment**.

This project aims to support efforts to ensure universal access to clean water and improve global health outcomes through data-driven approaches.
