The following steps will be taken: \n\n### Data Cleaning:  \n\n-   Handling Missing value (removal of incomplete records) \n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Identify and remove duplicate records \n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Standardize data formats (date formats, numerical conversions) \n\n### Filtering and Transformation  \n\n-   Select key variables relevant to the study, such as clean water access, death rate per 100,000 population  \n\n### Data Integration\n\n-   Merge WHO water data with World Bank sanitation statistic for understanding the relationship between waterborne disease and access to unsafe water source  \n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Geocode data for geospatial visualization  \n\n##  Geospatial Data Analysis  \n\nThe objective of the geospatial Data Analysis is to understand and identify spatial disparities in water accessibility and unsafe water-related deaths.  \n\n-   Interactive heatmap will be developed that represents: \n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Areas with low access to clean water  \n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   High Concentration of unsafe water usage  \n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Death rate due to unsafe water usage and sanitation  \n\nThe choropleth maps will be used where different color intensities represent severity level. \n\n## Time series Analysis  \n\nThe object of this analysis is to identify the trend and predict future patterns in water safety and sanitation overtime  \n\n-   Incorporate forecasting models using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL) and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) to project future trends in:  \n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Water accessibility improvements over the years  \n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Death rates related to unsafe water  \n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Sanitation coverage change (People with basic handwashing facilities including soap and water % of population) over time  \n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Identify in seasonal spikes, long-term trends in water safety  \n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Design interactive time sliders for temporal exploration  \n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Evaluate and compare different forecasting model \n\n## Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA) \n\nThe objective of confirmatory data analysis is to validate the statistical relationship between water accessibility, sanitation and health outcomes.  \n\n-   Correlation Analysis will be conducted to determine relationship between  \n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Clean water access and health outcomes  \n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Unsafe water exposure and mortality rate attributed to unsafe water, sanitation.  \n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Hypothesis testing of t-test and ANOVA will be conducted to verify significant difference in water access between different regions  \n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Regression model will be used to examine the influence of sanitation and water  \n\n# Prototype \n\n# R packages \n\nThe team intends to use the following R packages to develop and deploy the interactive visual analytics application\n\n-   **tidyverse**: A family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis, and communication tasks, including creating static statistical graphs.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   **knitr**: A report generation tool that facilitates dynamic document creation in R.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   **dplyr**: An R package for data manipulation and working with data frames efficiently.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   **plotly**: An R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs and visualizing data dynamically.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   **DT**: An R interface to the JavaScript library **DataTables**, which creates interactive tables for HTML pages.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   **lubridate**: An R package that simplifies working with **dates and time elements**.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   **ggforce**: An extension of **ggplot2** that provides additional geoms and stats for advanced visual data analysis.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   **highcharter**: A wrapper around the ‘Highcharts’ JavaScript library, allowing for highly interactive and customizable plotting of R objects.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   **sf**: An R package that supports the **importing, managing, and processing of geospatial data**, essential for mapping analysis.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   **spdep**: An R package that facilitates spatial analysis by handling geospatial data dependencies and relationships.\n\n# Conclusion \n\n# Project Schedule\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Proposal_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
