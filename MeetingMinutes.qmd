# Meeting Minutes 1

**Date:** March 11, 2025\
**Time:** 14:00 - 17:30\
**In Attendance:** Fan Jing, Lin Xinyue, Lai Meihao

**Agenda:**

1.  Discussion on the project topic

2.  Division of tasks for project proposal

3.  Action Items

**1. Discussion on the Project Topic**

Prior to the meeting, we reviewed senior work and explored possible topic areas.

**Proposed Ideas**

**Xinyue:**

-   Tropical rainforest dynamics coverage analysis (rejected due to lack of data)

-   SDG Goal 2 - Zero Hunger, focusing on food waste and world hunger statistics (initially agreed upon but later rejected due to difficulties collecting food waste data)

-   World health issues (considered but rejected as most data only covered 2019 and 2022 with many missing values, making time series forecasting difficult)

**Jing:**

-   Singapore population demographics analysis and forecast (rejected due to decreasing fertility rates and unpredictable immigration numbers)

-   German population demographic shift analysis alongside policies for foreigners and immigrants (rejected due to unfamiliarity with German policies)

-   World GDP analysis and time series forecast (rejected due to varying industry focuses across countries and the associated workload

-   The future of AI and workplace (rejected due to limited available data)

**Meihao:**

-   Maritime port import/export analysis focusing on Singapore's trading relationships (rejected due to unclear motivation)

-   Tourism and CPI/exchange rate analysis for seasonal changes and tourist season forecasting (initially agreed upon but rejected due to difficulties obtaining historical exchange rates)

-   How do jet fuel price effect Singapore Airline Group’s Revenue( rejected due to difficulties obtaining historical Oil Price for a reliable source)

**Selected Topic**

After reviewing Xinyue's data, the team generated the idea of exploring water-related issues. Relevant datasets were found, and the topic was selected. The team agreed to work on water sanitation issues such as:

-   Sufficient data is available for analysis

-   The topic includes appropriate variables for study

**2. Division of Tasks for Project Proposal**

After reviewing senior work, the team decided on the proposal structure and distributed responsibilities:

**Jing:**

-   Motivation

-   Objectives

-   Problem statement

-   Data

-   GitHub and Netlify setup

**Xinyue:**

-   Sketch of the prototypes and Explanation

-   Expected contribution and impact

-   Conclusion

**Meihao:**

-   Methodology

-   Project schedule

-   Relevant work

-   R package list

**3. Action Items**

-   All members to push their work to GitHub for peer review

-   Jing will handle the final submission on Wednesday

# **Meeting Minutes 2**

**Date**: March 17, 2025\
**Time**: 21:00 - 21:30\
**Attendees**: Fan Jing, Lin Xinyue, Lai Meihao

**Agenda**

1.  **Discussion on Proposal Feedback**

2.  **Action Items**

**1. Discussion on Proposal Feedback**

Identified Issues from Feedback

1.  Lack of clear allocation of analysis modules to team members.

2.  Concerns about the appropriateness of the suggested dataset.

3.  Recommendation to use web-based predictive modeling or machine learning forecasting instead of traditional time series analysis.

Decisions & Next Steps

1\. Allocation of Analysis Modules

After discussion, the following responsibilities were assigned:

-   Jing: Data cleaning and data processing

-   Xinyue: Geospatial data analysis

-   Meihao: Forecasting

All Members: Collaborate on Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA)

2\. Dataset Appropriateness

The team realized that for geospatial data analysis, the dataset needs to be in shp, API, or other suitable formats instead of the current CSV format.

-   Solution: It was found CSV files can be converted to shp or JSON for geospatial analysis after research.

    -   Meihao will test whether the files can be converted to shp or Json.

    -   Jing and Xinyue will focus on selecting relevant variables and assessing the dataset’s suitability

3\. Forecasting Approach

-   The team agreed to shift from traditional time series forecasting to web-based predictive modeling or machine learning forecasting.

-   The specific methodology will be further discussed and finalized in upcoming meetings.

**2. Action Items**

| Task | Responsible | Deadline |
|----|----|----|
| Test CSV-to-SHP/JSON conversion | Meihao | Next meeting |
| Select relevant variables for analysis | Jing & Xinyue | Next meeting |
| Research and discuss predictive modeling techniques | All Members | Ongoing |

Next Steps: The team will review progress in the next meeting and finalize the predictive modeling approach.

# Meeting Minutes 3

**Date**: March 13, 2025\
**Time**: 11:20 – 12:30\
**Attendees**: Fan Jing, Lin Xinyue, Lai Meihao

**Agenda**

1.  **Discussion after consultation with Dr. Kam**

2.  **Action Items**

**1. Discussion after Consultation with Dr. Kam**

The meeting focused on addressing dataset and methodology concerns raised during the consultation with Dr. Kam. Key takeaways include:

Dataset Concerns

-   The current world-level dataset contains many missing values, making a choropleth map less meaningful.

-   A tree map would be a more appropriate visualization if the group continues using this dataset.

-   Choropleth maps are better suited for national-level data.

Methodology Recommendations

-   For time series and regression analysis, Dr. Kam recommended using:

    -   plm for time series regression analysis.

    -   ExPanDa for visualization.

-   If continuing with the current data set, the Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA) should focus on a regional perspective or developing countries or other categorization rather than global trends.

Team Discussion & Next Steps

-   Jing strongly advocated for continuing with the current dataset.

-   Xinyue and Meihao suggested exploring regional or national-level data for more meaningful insights.

The group agreed to conduct further research before making a final decision.

**2. Action Items**

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| **Task** | **Assigned To** | **Deadline** |
| Continue variable selection using the current dataset | Jing | Ongoing |
| Research alternative datasets (regional/national level) | Meihao & Xinyue | Next meeting |
| Evaluate dataset feasibility and finalize the decision | Entire Team | Next meeting |
