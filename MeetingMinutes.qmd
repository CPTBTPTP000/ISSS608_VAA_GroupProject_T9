# **Meeting Minutes 2**

**Date**: March 17, 2025\
**Time**: 21:00 - 21:30\
**Attendees**: Fan Jing, Lin Xinyue, Lai Meihao

**Agenda**

1.  **Discussion on Proposal Feedback**

2.  **Action Items**

**1. Discussion on Proposal Feedback**

Identified Issues from Feedback

1.  Lack of clear allocation of analysis modules to team members.

2.  Concerns about the appropriateness of the suggested dataset.

3.  Recommendation to use web-based predictive modeling or machine learning forecasting instead of traditional time series analysis.

Decisions & Next Steps

1\. Allocation of Analysis Modules

After discussion, the following responsibilities were assigned:

-   Jing: Data cleaning and data processing

-   Xinyue: Geospatial data analysis

-   Meihao: Forecasting

All Members: Collaborate on Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA)

2\. Dataset Appropriateness

The team realized that for geospatial data analysis, the dataset needs to be in shp, API, or other suitable formats instead of the current CSV format.

-   Solution: It was found CSV files can be converted to shp or JSON for geospatial analysis after research.

    -   Meihao will test whether the files can be converted to shp or Json.

    -   Jing and Xinyue will focus on selecting relevant variables and assessing the dataset’s suitability

3\. Forecasting Approach

-   The team agreed to shift from traditional time series forecasting to web-based predictive modeling or machine learning forecasting.

-   The specific methodology will be further discussed and finalized in upcoming meetings.

**2. Action Items**

| Task | Responsible | Deadline |
|----|----|----|
| Test CSV-to-SHP/JSON conversion | Meihao | Next meeting |
| Select relevant variables for analysis | Jing & Xinyue | Next meeting |
| Research and discuss predictive modeling techniques | All Members | Ongoing |

Next Steps: The team will review progress in the next meeting and finalize the predictive modeling approach.

# Meeting Minutes 3

**Date**: March 13, 2025\
**Time**: 11:20 – 12:30\
**Attendees**: Fan Jing, Lin Xinyue, Lai Meihao

**Agenda**

1.  **Discussion after consultation with Dr. Kam**

2.  **Action Items**

**1. Discussion after Consultation with Dr. Kam**

The meeting focused on addressing dataset and methodology concerns raised during the consultation with Dr. Kam. Key takeaways include:

Dataset Concerns

-   The current world-level dataset contains many missing values, making a choropleth map less meaningful.

-   A tree map would be a more appropriate visualization if the group continues using this dataset.

-   Choropleth maps are better suited for national-level data.

Methodology Recommendations

-   For time series and regression analysis, Dr. Kam recommended using:

    -   plm for time series regression analysis.

    -   ExPanDa for visualization.

-   If continuing with the current data set, the Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA) should focus on a regional perspective or developing countries or other categorization rather than global trends.

Team Discussion & Next Steps

-   Jing strongly advocated for continuing with the current dataset.

-   Xinyue and Meihao suggested exploring regional or national-level data for more meaningful insights.

The group agreed to conduct further research before making a final decision.

**2. Action Items**

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| **Task** | **Assigned To** | **Deadline** |
| Continue variable selection using the current dataset | Jing | Ongoing |
| Research alternative datasets (regional/national level) | Meihao & Xinyue | Next meeting |
| Evaluate dataset feasibility and finalize the decision | Entire Team | Next meeting |

# Meeting Minutes 4

Date: March 14, 2025

Time: 21:00 – 21:30

Attendees: Fan Jing, Lin Xinyue, Lai Meihao

## Agenda

Project progress check-in and task realignment based on updated dataset availability

## 1. Team Progress Update and Dataset Decision

The meeting began with updates from each group member on their progress and any data challenges faced.

Regional Data Outcome\
\
Xinyue and Meihao were initially unable to locate appropriate region-specific datasets. However, Xinyue later discovered that disease outcome data grouped by WHO regions was available. After reviewing its structure and coverage, the group agreed that future analyses should shift to a regional-level focus based on WHO regional classifications.

Task Allocation and Module Development\
\
Each member’s task was clarified and finalized as follows:\
- Jing will be responsible for Treemap visualization and corresponding data exploration\
- Meihao will focus on the Panel Data Model (PLM)\
- Xinyue will work on the Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA)\
\
The team agreed to work independently on their respective modules, with plans to reconvene after individual components are complete to integrate them into a full Shiny App.

## 2. Action Items

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| **Task** | **Assigned To** | **Deadline** |
| Perform |  |  |
| treemap visualization and exploratory analysis | Jing | Next meeting |
| Build panel data regression model (PLM) | Meihao | Next meeting |
| Conduct confirmatory data analysis (CDA) | Xinyue | Next meeting |

# Meeting Minutes 5

Date: April 1, 2025

Time: 15:00 – 17:00

Attendees: Fan Jing, Lin Xinyue, Lai Meihao

## Agenda

Post-submission review and feedback discussion with Dr. Kam on the completed Shiny App

## 1. Consultation Review and Feedback Summary

After the completion of the initial version of the Shiny App, the group met with Dr. Kam to gather feedback and professional advice.\
\
Key Issues Identified:\
\
- Inconsistency in analysis level:\
  The current analysis mixes regional-level and country-level indicators, which makes interpretation unclear. Dr. Kam advised that all parts of the analysis should be aligned to the same level of granularity — either fully regional or fully country-level.\
\
- Visualization problems:\
  Several visualizations were flagged as ineffective or unclear. They were considered poor in presentation and not meaningful for analysis. The group agreed that these need to be redesigned and improved for clarity and analytical value.\
\
  All members will be responsible for improving their own visualization components, including:\
  - Jing’s treemap\
  - Xinyue’s CDA visualizations\
  - Meihao’s PLM visual outputs\
\
- PLM Model clarity:\
  The current PLM component focuses too much on results without clearly explaining or presenting the model structure itself. This part will be revised to better reflect how the model is built, not just the output.\
\
- WHO region naming issue:\
  The current WHO region labels were noted as inappropriate or inconsistent. The team will need to either reassign the region groupings or re-arrange the dataset to resolve the naming issues.

## 2. Action Items

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| **Task** | **Assigned To** | **Deadline** |
| Decide whether to adopt country-level or regional-level analysis | Entire Team | Next meeting |
| Reformat and correct regional naming in the dataset | Meihao & Xinyue | Next meeting |
| Revise treemap visualization for clarity | Jing | Next meeting |
| Revise CDA visualization component | Xinyue | Next meeting |
| Revise PLM model to focus on structure and improve output presentation | Meihao | Next meeting |
| All members to review and improve their own visualizations | Entire Team | Next meeting |

# Meeting Minutes 6

Date: April 1, 2025

Time: 21:30 – 21:50

Attendees: Fan Jing, Lin Xinyue, Lai Meihao

## Agenda

Review of new country-level disease dataset and planning for final integration and poster preparation

## 1. Dataset Update and Task Realignment

The team identified a new disease dataset at the country level, which can be aligned with UN region groupings, allowing for both country-level and regional-level analysis. The team agreed to move forward with this dataset, and integrate it with the existing WDI dataset.\
\
Due to missing values, some variables will be removed and the analysis time range will be adjusted to 2006–2021 for consistency and completeness.\
\
In light of the data change:\
- The treemap visualization will be replaced with an EDA module for trend review of all variables\
- The team agreed to continue working on their respective modules using the new data\
- Aiming to finish by April 3, allowing time for poster preparation\
\
Poster Plan:\
- Xinyue will be responsible for assembling the poster\
